title: An Introduction to Monads
smalltext: Chris Van Horne
tags: talk
---

Continuing from the "Haskell in 15 Minutes" talk from last week, Chris will
cover monads and remove some of their mystique. The talk will give the
rationale of monads in a pure lazy functional language like Haskell. The
Wadler interpreter will be the vehicle of discovery for derivation of two
standard Haskell monads: <code>Maybe</code> and <code>Writer</code>.
