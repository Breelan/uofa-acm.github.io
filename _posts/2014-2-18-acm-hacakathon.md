On February 28th thru March 1st, we will be hosting our very first Hackathon
event at [Elegant Thought](http://www.elegantthought.com/).  The event will
take place from 6pm on Friday, to ~1-2pm on Saturday, with the competition
itself ending at noon.

So, in order to encourage as many people as possible, we will be spending
Friday night hosting a variety of workshops on topics that *you* want to hear
and learn about.  *This competition is open to any UA students with any degree
of programming experience*.

Right now, we have a handful of sponsors including Amazon, Google, Microsoft,
Roey Chasman, and Elegant Thought.  This means we will have a few categories
for participants to compete in, with each sponsor providing the prizes for a
category.

Because the event will be about 18-20 hours long, food will be provided, as
well as transportation for the duration of the event so that people can go home
and rest, take a break, etc.  This will be handled by volunteers from the ACM
officership and other ACM members.  This being said, we encourage people to
carpool but if you cannot, or do not have a means of transportation, you will
not be excluded from the competition.

More to come soon!
