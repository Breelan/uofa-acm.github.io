Metaprogramming is the practice of writing programs that produce new code. This
talk will serve as a gentle introduction to basic metaprogramming concepts. It
will include some of the history of metaprogramming, applications of
metaprogramming, and some examples in C++ and Python, though no experience in
either programming language is required.
