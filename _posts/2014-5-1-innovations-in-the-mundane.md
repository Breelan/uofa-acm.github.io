As my senior talk, I will be presenting components of the projects I have spent
the last year working on. Upon encountering a problem at work, I was challenged
to develop a creative solution that could change our throughput of projects
from one every 2 months to 1000+ every year.  I will be showing how, despite
not being an interesting challenge, interesting solutions are always present
and should always be embraced.  I will also be showing some of the technologies
that I have developed to achieve this fabled goal of 1000 projects per year.
