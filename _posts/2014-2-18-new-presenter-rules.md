We are announcing a new rule for everyone who is presenting to the club this
semester and that is: at some time before your talk, you **MUST** submit a pull
request to the [uofa-acm](http://www.github.com/uofa-acm/uofa-acm.github.io)
GitHub repository with a post describing the talk you are giving. There are
examples already on the website and a description in the
[README](https://github.com/uofa-acm/uofa-acm.github.io/blob/master/README.md).

This allows us to keep the website updated with summaries of your talks and
advertise them appropriately.  If you have any questions or run into any,
please contact one of the club officers.
