title: Thinking in Ensembles
smalltext: Chris Van Horne
summary: When you write a "Person" class, does it contain enough attributes to describe a person? Are we nothing more than eye color, hair color and height? Would you be surprised that it might be easier to write a "People" class than a "Person" class? How can this be? This talk will cover abstraction at the "groups instead of individuals" level and hint that this may likely be an intrinsic part of our universe(s).
