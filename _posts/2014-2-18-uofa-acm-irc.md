We now have our own channel on Freenode for any and everyone to join, chat with
each other, ask for help, provide help -- all without the burden of Facebook.
The motivation behind this was that we wanted an informal place for people to
be able to socialize and talk shop and get to know each other without the
sometimes awkward step of becoming friends on Facebook/G+/Twitter or having to
exchange email addresses.

For those of you who are not familiar with IRC (Internet Relay Chat), it is a
means of communicating in a chatroom-style environment with others.  It is 100%
free for anyone to use and can be accessed on any platform.

**To Join:**

Download an IRC client (Windows: mIRC, Linux: XChat, OSX/iOS: Colloquy, etc).

Server: chat.freenode.net
Channel: #uofa-acm

Please stop by and say hi!

(I encourage everyone to configure their various
clients to join automatically when your computer wakes up, it makes life a lot
easier.)
