As it turns out, a majority of our active members have played racquetball up 5 times or more.  (yes, that is mathematically
ambiguous, and [potentially annoying](http://xkcd.com/870/))

Therefore, after a brief tech talk, we will all walk over to the rec center to play a little bit of racquetball together.
Whether you are a racquetball novice or expert, there will be someone there that is on the same level as you are.

While the rec center allows you to check out gear, please bring any racquets you may have, as sometimes the racquets
all get checked out.

If you are curious about the rules, [the wikipedia rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racquetball#Rules) are comprehensive enough.

We hope you take this opportunity to blow off steam and hit stuff really hard.  It should be fun.
