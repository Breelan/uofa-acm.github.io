Welcome (back) everyone!  We are looking forward to another exciting semester
with the ACM club.

Here are some of the things we do throughout the year:
  * Weekly meetings with tech talks given by students just like you!
  * Club dinners after each meeting.  Come eat and socialiaze
  * ACM Intercollegiate Programming Competition
  * ACM Hack-a-thon
  * Special events with other CS clubs (like WICS)

This first meeting we will be introducing the club and what we do.

Furthmore, we will discuss potential topics to serve as the focus
of one of our weekly tech talks.  If you have anything in particular you want
to speak about, or wish to request a talk on a particular topic, please feel
free to let us know.

Join us for dinner on University after the meeting.
