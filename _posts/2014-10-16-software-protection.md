This ACM talk serves as an introduction to the realm of intellectual property law specifically related to software inventions. The discussion will mainly revolve around issues relevant to the perspective of the inventor (in this case a computer scientist in the midst of filing for a patent on a software invention). Central topics include the process and requirements behind obtaining a software patent, the reasons for doing so, and how to effectively avoid infringement. Other topics include recent litigation and legislation in the arena such as Alice Corp. vs. CLS Bank, patent assertion entities and the LOT agreement, the debate surrounding the open source movement, and more.
