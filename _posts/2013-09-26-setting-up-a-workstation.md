This week, Ben and Roey will be presenting some best-practices for efficient software development. We will first do an introduction to the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php) text editor, and explain why mastering a console-based editor is so useful. We will follow that up with a talk about [git](http://git-scm.com/).

These presentations are designed to give you a solid overview of these tools, so if you are new to all of this, no worries! If you have a Mac, Linux or Windows laptop, feel free to bring it and follow along with the presenters.
