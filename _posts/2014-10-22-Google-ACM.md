Google developers and recruiters will be meeting with ACM on Wednesday AT
5:30pm in Gould-Simpson 942.

The event will be informal, where members of ACM will have the chance to
network with and ask questions to Google representatives.  This is a good
opportunity if you are curious what its like to be a developer at Google, and
why you might want to work there.

Coffee and snacks will be provided.  Hope to see you all there.
