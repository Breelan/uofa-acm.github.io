One of the things we barely emphasize at the U of A is how to test your code - and not just doing unit tests either. I've noticed that industry doesn't necessarily emphasize it either. But how can we guarantee our product will work if we don't heavily test it? I'll be going over how to bring in UI Testing (using selenium and unit tests) to test interactions with the product, as well as how to mock interactions with outside sites to fully test your code.
