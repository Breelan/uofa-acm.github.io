summary: An introduction to GAs and what their metaphors reveal about code.

Genetic Algorithms are algorithms that are modeled from biological reproduction
found in nature.

GAs attempt to find optimal solutions to problems sets, just like in reality
these algorithms adapt to find new solutions when their environments change.

GAs carry metaphors that help us think about how to relate reality to code
for creating novel abstractions. I hope to inspire ideas of how to implement
models of other mappings of reality that could potentially have useful
application.

Examples are shown as visualizations done in processing. Processing.js is a
visualization language which compiles to JavaScript and renders into fancy
graphics. Code examples require no experience in processing.
