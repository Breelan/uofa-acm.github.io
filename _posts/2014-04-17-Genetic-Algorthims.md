Genetic Algorithms are algorithms that are modeled from biological reproduction
found in nature.

GAs give us ways to attempt to find optimal solutions to problems sets that
can react and adapt to changes in the problem set.

Metaphors like Genes and Populations help to relate our code to reality for
creating powerful abstractions. How can other mappings of reality be
implemented to alter the way our GA behaves?

Examples are shown as visualizations done in processing. Processing.js is a
visualization language which compiles to JavaScript and renders into fancy
graphics. Code examples require no experience in processing is required.
