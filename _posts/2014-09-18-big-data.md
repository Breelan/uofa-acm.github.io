One of the biggest technologies in industry today is big data. As the amount of data in the world grows, the demand for people in the data field increases.

For my talk, I'll be going over the basics of big data. I'll talk about what's included in big data, as well as how it is received, stored, and then retrieved. Also, as I work with large amounts of data, I'll be sharing some of my own experience as I go through the talk.
