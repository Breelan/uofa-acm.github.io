Show up and hang-out. Talk about the [HN-flavor](http://news.ycombinator.com)
of the day, your favorite subreddit, or just vent your weekly-CS irritations.
You're welcome to continue the discussion afterwards while enjoying a few
drinks. <span class='red'>Aftermath:</span> We ended up solving two problems from the 2011 competition,
enjoyed a discussion on embedding Python, a primer on core concepts in the ACM
[competition](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/acm/LocalContest/Problems08.pdf), and a look at other competitions outside of ICPC. The night ended
with drinks and food at a local bar.
