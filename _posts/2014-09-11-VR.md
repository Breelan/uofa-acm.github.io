What do old hockey stadiums, 1980’s soda machines, 2030’s downtown Tucson and Star Trek have in common? How can the same virtual environment be easily navigated with a mouse and keyboard on a pc, over the web on a browser, in a Virtual Reality CAVE or through an Oculus Rift and Omnidirectional Treadmill (even sets of all three in the same networked world)? And when are we going to get around to building the Matrix (without the robots taking over)?

During the September 11th ACM meeting, join Steven Eiselen, an undergrad CS major and assistant in the UITS AZLIVE Laboratory for a talk on real world applications with virtual reality and 3D modelling.
