Hey guys! It’s that time of year again.

That’s right, the ACM International Collegiate Programming Competition is upon us! Join us November 1st in GS 228 from 8:45am - 2pm for a few hours of programming, fun, and (of course) free food! Microsoft will be sponsoring the event, and the top four teams get to participate in the Regional ICPC, and have a chance to go to the World Finals in Morocco in May.

You can sign up at the link below, space is limited so sign up quickly! Entrants will consist of teams of 3, but if you can’t find a full team, sign up anyways and we’ll group you up with other interested parties on the day of the competition.

Also, please see the rules page linked below for entry requirements. Any UA student can participate in this contest. To advance to the Regional contest, all members of the team must be eligible to participate in the Regional contest. Please see the link below and indicate your standing on the application.
