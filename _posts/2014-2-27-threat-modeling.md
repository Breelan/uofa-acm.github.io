In production environments, especially immediately after inheriting a project, 
asking a piece of software to immediately "be secure" is unreasonable. Thus,
threat models are created to prioritize fixing vulnerabilities. This talk covers
the basics of vulnerability identification, assesment, and patching, using the 
DREAD and STRIDE threat models and the [Buggy Web Application Project](http://www.itsecgames.com/) 
as an example.
