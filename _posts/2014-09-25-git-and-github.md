Bring your laptop to ACM for this one.  Its going to be a hands on introduction
to git and github.  We will use the
[ACM Homepage Source](https://github.com/uofa-acm/uofa-acm.github.io)
as an
example, so that everyone knows how to contribute.

One person will be leading the walk-through, while experienced members of
the club will be meandering around helping anyone who needs it.

In order for us to have a productive meeting, there is some software you need
to install before hand.

1. Go to [the git homepage](githttp://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
   , find your operating system, and follow the instructions to install git.
2. Go to [github](https://github.com/) and create and account
