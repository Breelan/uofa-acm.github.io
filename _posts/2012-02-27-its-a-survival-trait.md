Stripe is hosting a 6-level [capture the flag](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag)
competition and we want to show you how to get to level 6! It's up to you to solve the
last problem, but we will walk you the first five. We'll explain and demonstrate buffer
overflows, stack smashing, shellcode, regex exploits, and more.
