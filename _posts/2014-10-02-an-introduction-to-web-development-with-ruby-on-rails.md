smalltext: Zach Montoya
summary: Learn the basics of web development using the Ruby on Rails framework

---

Ruby on Rails is a powerful web application framework that allows you to be
productive and write well-structured, easy-to-understand code, instead of focusing
on the complex infrastructure necessary to implement a web site all by yourself.
A more detailed introduction to the framework can be found
[here](http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html).

This talk will introduce the fundamentals of web development and then
will move into a basic exploration of Ruby on Rails.
There will also be a small demonstration to show how quickly and easily
Ruby on Rails allows you to build a website, just by using an
object-oriented mindset, even with minimal knowledge of databases.
