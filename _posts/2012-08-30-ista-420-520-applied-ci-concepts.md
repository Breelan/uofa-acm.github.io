This class will count towards a CSc tech-elective and is three units.
It aims to provide topics on large data storage, analysis, distribution, and
visualization. You will get hands-on experience with tools that power many
CI projects, as well as collaborate with other students to solve interesting
case-dilemmas in class. If you're interested, [then apply online](http://goo.gl/p4j3m).
