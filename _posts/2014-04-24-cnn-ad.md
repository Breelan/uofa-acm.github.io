This will be a 10,000 foot view of artificial neural networks (ANNs),
the convolution, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and automatic
differentiation. ANNs will be shown graphically: what they look like
structurally, what they can recognize, what they can create after
being trained, backpropogation and gradients. Finally, we will cover
a neat technique called automatic differentiation for calculating
exact gradients used during backpropogation learning as opposed
to the traditional difference quotient or symbolic manipulation methods.
