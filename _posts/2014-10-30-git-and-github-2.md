Following up with Matt Gautreau's talk earlier in the semester, we'll be
discussing the purpose and functionality of maintaining projects in both
local and remote repositories using Git and Github.

We'll also have an interactive portion wherein users can fork from the 
[U of A ACM Homepage Repository](https://github.com/uofa-acm/uofa-acm.github.io),
implement their own member profile, and post the results to the live ACM 
website!

To prepare yourself, [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
and [create a Github account](https://github.com/) before the meeting if possible

Also, check out the [Git Immersion tutorial](http://gitimmersion.com/) if you want
to prepare for the material beforehand.

Slides and instructions for posting a member profile to the website will
be posted after the meeting.
